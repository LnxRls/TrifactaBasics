# Trifacta Basics

Files used during basic experimentation with Trifacta

## Description

The jpgs show the lay out of the Trifacta flows created during testing. I cannot upload the flows b/c I used the free edition of the SW that doesn't allow flow sharing. 
The csv file is a raw txt file used to follow the video exercises as showing at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz7Rx3q_HkY&list=PLaLiWJlnGCkRBp5pWoaXWsW5oZjlguyBe
The results zip has the flow output files compressed b/c of their size. The NOAA result file was produced using the "ghcnd-inventory.txt" and "ghcnd-stations.txt" txt files 
I downloaded from https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/
